The following addition points are noted about the Shell.

1)  EMS 3.2 or above is required if expanded memory is to be used.

2)  It has been tested on MS-DOS 3.3 and 4.0 and under OS/2 in the
    DOS box.

3)  Not all the addition library functions are required.  Some are
    just included for your interest.  Their functionality is
    briefly described below:

	director.c (required)

	MSDOS versions of the POSIX directory (3) functions (see
	POSIX standards and Unix manual pages for further information).

	getopt.c (required)

	The getopt function

	stdargv.c (required)

	A replacement for the standard Microsoft library stdargv.obj.
	This function tries to provide the wildcard expansion functionality
	normally provided by Unix.  *, ?, [] and \ are supported.
	Environment variables are expanded and the selection of files
	across wildcard drive letters is supported (ie *:*.c will
	expand to all the .c files in the current directory of all
	drives).

	pnmatch.c (required)

	A pattern match function used by stdargv

	ms_dio.c

	A set of functions to allow you to do raw disk and memory
	I/O.  The include file ms_dio has a set of macros to
	change the normal library calls so that they go via this
	package.

	popen.c

	A version of popen for MS-DOS

	syserr.c

	A modified version of the standard Microsoft error list.
