To rebuild and install the shell, you should follow the following the
steps:

1)  Load the include files in the include directory into the standard
    location (\msc\include or equivalent).  Read CHANGES file for the
    additional definitions which are required in the standard Microsoft
    5 include files and edit them in to the appropriate files.

    We have standardised our MSDOS and Unix include files such that
    the same include file exists our Unix system and MSDOS systems.
    This makes porting a lot easier.  If you don't want to edit the
    standard include files, you will have to generate an new include
    file for the shell and include it as the first include in all the
    C sources for the additional library functions and the Shell itself

2)  Modify the library function open so that the O_NOINHERIT flag is
    passed to MSDOS by the library.  This is not strictly necessary.
    I did it using CodeView to see where the library function masks
    the bottom three bits, noted the bytes around this location,
    extracted the open function from the library, patched the mask
    to be 0x83 instead of 0x03, and then replaced the function in the
    library (Also see the Patch.Lib file).

3)  Compile the library files in the directory /lib in large model mode
    and add the objects to your large model library

    cl -c -AL -Olt *.c
    <appropriate library commands>

4)  Build the shell, either using make or

    cl -c -AL -Olt *.c
    masm /Ml sh0.asm
    link sh0+sh1+sh2+sh3+sh4+sh5+sh6+sh7+sh8+sh9+sh10/noi, sh.exe;

    Note that the order is important.  SH0.OBJ must be the first object
    file in the load line.

    Install the shell in its correct location.

5)  Modify the initialisation file sh.ini for your edit key preferences.

6)  Modify the scripts as appropriate for your installation and install
    them in the correct directories.

7)  Type "sh -0" and see what happens.
