Version 1.6.2 Release Notes:

Note: Release 1.6.1 did occur to comp.ibm.pc.binaries.  However, the
transmission was corrupt and by the time I was notified (the moderator having
been in hospital), release 1.6.2 was ready.  So the source patches for
1.6.1 where not released.

The following problems have been fixed in 1.6.2 (including 1.6).

   1.   Traps did now work correctly (as far as possible for DOS) la System
	V.3
   2.   File descriptor duplication closed standard input.
   3.   !! has been implemented to return the previous command in the history
	file
   4.   erase_to_end_of_line has been improved/fixed
   5.   The processing of . filename has been fixed so that the script is
	now executed immediately.  This is the area most likely to contain
	bugs.
   6.   History does not double prompt
   7.	Bugs in the 'here' document code delete backslashes and prevented
	`command` in a here document from working.
   8.   Interrupting a pipeline could result in std??? remaining redirected
   9.   exec >filename did not work
  10.   Some temporary files were not deleted.
  11.   The swapper failed to check for disk full errors
  12.   The full path name is provided to the DOS spawn interrupt so that
	the PICNIX utilities now work.
  13.   Certain areas of code are now protected against interruption which
	would cause hanging.
  14.	The original directory is restored on exit.
  15.	A couple of missing setarea having been added to stop hangs
  16.	The input buffer is correctly initialised and nulls are added so
	that the correct command is saved when an interrupt occurs.
  17.	An error in the reloading of buffers from files has been fixed.
  18.	The directory routines have been modified to correctly handle
	all valid Unix format directory names (ie a Unix directory name
	can end in /.  However, DOS does not think this is a directory).

The following enhancements have been made:

   1.   /dev/tty and /dev/null are mapped to /dev/con and /dev/nul internally
   2.   <up arrow> returns the previous history command
   3.   <page up> will now search for the previous history entry matching
	the entered string
   4.   The shell determines the number of columns on the screen from the
	BIOS
   5.   Shell scripts are detected in a new manner.  For a file to be a
	shell script, it must contain no characters with values in the
	range 0 to 7 in the first 512 bytes.
   6.   #! <command> <arguments> processing on the first line of script files
	has been implemented a la System V.4
   7.   XMS drivers are now supported
   8.   Some static buffers are now 'malloced' instead and some length
	checks have been added
   9.   Insert command selects a full or halfheight block cursor
   10.  .bat files are processed by the shell specified by the variable
	COMSPEC.
   11.  UNIX format PATH variables are converted MSDOS format
   12.  The shell attempts to find the number of lines on the screen from
	the BIOS
   13.  File name completion has been implemented
   14.  Erase input buffer has been implemented
   15.  A Configuration file (sh.ini) allows the user to configure the
	editor keys
   16.  Quoting of arugments with white space in them to MSDOS commands
	has been added.
   17.  Full internal Interrup 24 support is provided.
   18.  The amount of data written to swap file by only dumping the
	data and stack space after the first write.
   19.	The ms_dio function have been enhanced to support raw and block
	devices (well not really - just the stat and fstat functions).

The following enhancements/bugs remain outstanding:

    1.  The processing of the escape character (\) is not consistent with
	the System V shell.  The MS-Shell always strips the first escape
	character.  The System V shell only strips escape characters when
	it detects a shell special character following (Release 1.7).

	ie.  echo "\033[H" works under System V however echo "\\033[H" is
	required in the MSDOS shell.

    2.  8 Bit character are not supported.  This is tied in with the
	processing of escape characters.  The shell uses the 8-bit to
	mark escaped characters (Release 1.7).
